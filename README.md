# GNOME Shell Extension Alt+Tab Scroll Workaround

> Quick fix to the bug where scrolling in one application is repeated in another when switching between them using `Alt+Tab` (e.g., VS Code and Chrome)

As an example, after scrolling VS Code and switching to Chrome using `Alt+Tab`, `Super+Tab`, `Alt+Esc`, or overview (hot corner or `Super`) + mouse click, the VS Code scroll would be repeated in Chrome. Installing the extension should avoid this.

**GNOME 45 supported!**

This bug is described in several open issues:
